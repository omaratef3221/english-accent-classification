# English Accent Classification

This project provides an end-to-end pipeline for classifying English accents from audio samples using deep learning. It includes a training notebook, a PyTorch model, and a user-friendly Streamlit web app for real-time accent prediction.

## Overview

- **Notebook:** The `Audio_Classification_Model.ipynb` notebook demonstrates data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for accent classification using a public dataset.
- **Web App:** The `app.py` file provides a Streamlit interface for uploading `.mp3` files and predicting the accent using the trained model.
- **Model:** The model architecture is defined in `model.py` and the trained weights are saved in `model.pth`.

## Usage

- **Web App:**  
  1. Open the Streamlit app.
  2. Upload an `.mp3` audio file (5 seconds recommended).
  3. View the predicted accent and confidence scores.

- **Notebook:**  
  Use `Audio_Classification_Model.ipynb` to explore data loading, training, and evaluation. You can adapt it for further experimentation or retraining.

## Model Details

- **Architecture:**  
  The model is a simple CNN for spectrogram classification, defined in `model.py`.
- **Input:**  
  Mel-spectrograms of audio clips, resized to 128x256.
- **Classes:**  
  The model predicts among 20+ English accents (see `label_names` in `app.py`).
